# Shareable Environments
Here you will find a collection of shareable environments create by the community. You can download these and inport them into your map with the import function.
```ts
importShareableEnv("Billie Cubes.dat")
```
Or you can use them on any map by putting them in `Beat Saber Install Folder\UserData\Chroma\Environments` and enabling them ingame.

## PRs

If you have an environment that you would like to see here. Don't hesitate to pull-request it, or send it to the MapKey Discord and we will happily add it to the list.
