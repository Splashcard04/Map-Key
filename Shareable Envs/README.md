# Shareable Environments
Here you will find a collection of shareable environments created by the community. You can download these and inport them into your map with the import function.
```ts
importShareableEnv("Billie Cubes.dat")
```
Or you can use them on any map by putting them in this folder `Beat Saber Install Folder\UserData\Chroma\Environments` and enabling them ingame.
