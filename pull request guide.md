# Map Key Pull Request Guide

if you didnt already know, map key is an extension for remapper which is composed of mostly utils, if you would like to pr your own function, constant or preset, follow this guide.

## Functions / Utils
to pr a function make sure that it includes js doc formatted as mine is, if you would like to discuss yout pull request or just *life* join the [map key discord](https://discord.gg/jSNFFTxACe)
Include parameters and do your best to format as mine as the functionality should be reletivaly similar for user advantage.  If you do pr something that I think is a good Idea but could use some more execution of some sort, I will make changes but plsease dont be offended by this, I just want your function to be its best self!

## Constants
to pr a constant, make sure you edit the constants.ts file and format as mine are, new constant categories are allowed of course, as well as additional environment IDs or something of the sort.

### conclusion
Im really not gonna mind if you pr at all, I will give it a look and 99% of the time I will probably merge it, thank you for reading and have a good day.
